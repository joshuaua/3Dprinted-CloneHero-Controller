# 3D Printed Clone Hero Controller

## What You'll Need

### Tools
- 3D printer
- Soldering iron

### Parts
- Printer filament
  - XXXg of PLA or PETG
  - (Optional) XXXg of ABS
    
    Small amount required for printing fret buttons if you want to smooth them with acetone.

- 9 x Low profile mechanical key switches
- Light duty wire
  
  Any thin wire will work. Approx. 2 metres of stranded Cat 5e (ethernet) cable will contain enough wire for the entire project with spare.

- 21 x M3x20mm screws
- 21 x M3 hex nuts
  
  Optional but will add strength to the build.

- Microcontroller

  You only need one of these, but there are several options for sending key signals to your PC. Any microcontroller you pick must be able to act as a "USB HID" or it won't work. For example, an Arduino Leonardo will also work for this project, but an Arduino Uno won't without additional hardware.
  - Arduino Pro Micro
    
    This is the more complex option but allows customisation with things like LED strips.
  - USB Encoder
