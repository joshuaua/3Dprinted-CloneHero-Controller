You probably don't need everything listed here, each build guide has its own specific shopping list. Tools 3D Printer You'll need access to a 3D printer with a minimum bed size of 219mm x 186mm x 150mm (219x186x150) to fit all the pieces. A 3D printing service is also an option but will make the build significantly more expensive. Soldering Iron A soldering iron and solder is needed to connect all the buttons to your microcontroller. Hot Glue Gun A hot glue gun and glue sticks are used to secure all the buttons and electronics inside the main body of the guitar. Print Smoothing Sanding Used to smooth parts of of buttons and the fret bar that come in contact with the guitar body. This depends on if you're using ABS acetone smoothing for the buttons, the tolerance of your printer and the layer height of your printed parts. ABS Smoothing Todo Add some other methods of smoothing prints here? Like in the video. Parts 3D Printer Filament The entire build will use approximately 650g of PLA filament. Any solid filament will work, but PLA is easiest to print and is inexpensive. While not required, it's recommended to also print the fret buttons using ABS filament which allows you to smooth them with acetone. The only requires approximately 15g (4m) of filament. Warning Printing with ABS produces toxic fumes! You need either a filtered enclosure for your printer, or a large well ventilated space to print safely. For the fret buttons to work well, it's critical that they're smoothed as much as possible, so they don't catch on the sides of the neck during use. Acetone smoothing gives the best possible finish and is much easier than sanding or painting. Mechanical Key Switches Wire Any thin light duty wire will work. Approximately 2 metres of stranded Cat 5e (ethernet) cable will contain enough wire for the entire project with spare. Cat 6 and solid core cable will also work but is a little harder to work with. M3 Screws M3 Hex Nuts Adds strength to the build. Microcontroller You only need one of these, but there are several options for sending key signals to your PC. Any microcontroller you pick must be able to act as a \"USB HID\" or it won't work. For example, an Arduino Leonardo will also work for this project, but an Arduino Uno won't without additional hardware. Info If you go with a programmable microcontroller, you'll also need a suitable USB cable. Make sure it's long enough to comfortably reach your computer and includes data pins. Most high quality USB cables will have them but some intended for charging only might be missing them. Arcade USB Encoder USB encoders are very simple microcontrollers designed for DIY arcade machines. You plug buttons into it, and it shows up as a joystick on your PC. They are much quicker than an Arduino to get running, but won't allow you to add features like programmable LED strips. These devices vary a lot in look and manufacturer but they all work the same. Arduino Pro Micro An Arduino Pro Micro is a fully programmable microcontroller. Its key features are the ability to act as a USB HID (an input device, like a keyboard or joystick) and built in pull up resistors on every pin cutting down on the number of components needed. This is the more complex option but allows customisation with things like LED strips, whammy bars and tilt sensors.","title":"Supplies"},{"location":"supplies/#supplies","text":"This is a detailed overview of all the tools and parts required for the controller builds.
